# Side-Projects
This repository holds the smaller projects I have worked on, which focuses more on learning specific languages and frameworks! Some of the projects included in this repository include:
- Birdle: a Wordle-based clone that tests users on 15+ words related to badminton concepts
- BudgetBuddy: an expense tracker that allows users to input transactions and regulate my spendings
- JackedPot (in progress!): a mobile fitness app that allows users to track workouts at the gym
