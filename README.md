# Side-Projects
This repository holds the smaller projects I have worked on, which focuses more on learning specific languages and frameworks! Some of the projects included in this repository include:
- **Birdle:** a Wordle-based clone that tests users on 15+ words related to badminton concepts
- **BudgetBuddy**: an expense tracker that allows users to input transactions and regulate my spendings
- **JackedPot (in progress!):** a mobile fitness app that allows users to track workouts at the gym
- **FRC Vision System:** 3D Object Detection system used for my team's robot during FRC 2023 Charged Up! (my team is Team 2706 if you want to check them out)
